        <p>If you’ve ever second-guessed your baking skills because your homemade bread doesn’t look or feel exactly like the picture-perfect loaves you might find in the bread aisle of the supermarket, fret not: There are many additives in store-bought breads that don’t usually appear in the average home kitchen. (Unless, that is, you regularly stock up on preservatives like propionates and EDTA.) And the main thing that keeps those plastic-wrapped loaves as soft as a pile of Siberian kittens is a family of ingredients that’s broadly known as dough conditioners.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup golden raisins</li>
            <li>1 large delicata squash (about 2 1/2 pounds), cut into 1/4" half-moons</li>
            <li>5 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for pan</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 450°F. Bring vinegar and 1/3 cup water to a simmer in a small pot. Remove from heat. Add raisins, cover, and let sit until ready to use.</p></li>
            <li><p>Divide squash, thyme, and garlic between 2 rimmed baking sheets; arrange in a single layer. Toss with 2 Tbsp. oil, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Roast 12 minutes. Toss, then add hazelnuts to 1 section of 1 sheet. Continue to roast until hazelnuts are toasted and browned and squash is tender and cooked through, about 6 minutes more.</p></li>
            <li><p>Whisk ricotta and cream in a medium bowl until smooth. Add 6 oz. mozzarella, 3/4 tsp. salt, and remaining 1/2 tsp. pepper and whisk to combine. Remove thyme leaves from stems and add to cheese mixture. Coarsely chop garlic, add to cheese mixture, and stir to combine.</p></li>
        </ul>
