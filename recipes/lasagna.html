        <p>Thinly sliced squash and kale (plus plenty of ricotta cheese) combine in this lasagna-like casserole that's perfect for a hearty winter dinner. Quick-pickled raisins and nutty hazelnuts add brightness and crunch.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup golden raisins</li>
            <li>1 large delicata squash (about 2 1/2 pounds), cut into 1/4" half-moons</li>
            <li>5 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for pan</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Bring vinegar and 1/3 cup water to a simmer in a small pot. Remove from heat. Add raisins, cover, and let sit until ready to use.</p></li>
            <li><p>Divide squash, thyme, and garlic between 2 rimmed baking sheets; arrange in a single layer. Toss with 2 Tbsp. oil, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Roast 12 minutes. Toss, then add hazelnuts to 1 section of 1 sheet. Continue to roast until hazelnuts are toasted and browned and squash is tender and cooked through, about 6 minutes more.</p></li>
            <li><p>Whisk ricotta and cream in a medium bowl until smooth. Add 6 oz. mozzarella, 3/4 tsp. salt, and remaining 1/2 tsp. pepper and whisk to combine. Remove thyme leaves from stems and add to cheese mixture. Coarsely chop garlic, add to cheese mixture, and stir to combine.</p></li>
        </ul>
